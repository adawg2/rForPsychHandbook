# Preface

This book serves as a collection of resources used in the LSU psychological statistics courses.
It contains some lecture notes, as well as R code and data to run each of the examples in R.

The book is still under construction and if you would like to help out with it, please get in touch!

The majority of the content comes from having taken and then TA's for the LSU psychology department's stats courses.
Was given oppertunity to work for psych department as music student, partially because of R, and writing this handbook was way of saying thank you for the great experience that I had.
Content was generated by both Jason Hicks and Jason Harman, I just provided R as the glue to hold it all together.
Idea is that anyone going through the LSU stats rotation would be able to if they wanted put in the extra work and learn R while they are doing the assigments in SPSS.
Data and content are from previous years, form same, content different.

As noted in next chapter, it's hard to learn R, but worth doing it.
Personally found that R has opened up more oppertunities than anything else I have invested in.
See it as investing in self.
Got started with it because of guy who advised my Masters thesis.
If you feel like you can't do this, know that reason I started R is I knew so little about computers, Daniel had to show me how to do an IFELSE() statement in Excel. 
At that point figured if I was going to learn, might as well be frustrated and get a better product out of it.

One thing to learn a lot by running these examples, though the best way forward is to find your own dataset and start to set up project with it.

Beauty of R is that you are trying to become a researcher.
R is cullinary school of statistics.
SPSS is a microwave.
Saw that on twitter.

Let's get cooking.

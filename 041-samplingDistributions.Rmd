# Sampling Distributions

In this chapter, we'll cover three ideas/questions.

1. What are inferential statistics and the logic behind them
2. What the underlying distribution of all hypothetical sample estimates is known as the sampling distribution, and it constitutes the third of the three important distributions.
3. Several important implications follow from an understanding of the sampling distribution as a normal distribution and from the central limit theorem

Spoken about a bit before in the other chapter, we have both sample statistics like $\bar{X}$ and population parameters $\mu$.

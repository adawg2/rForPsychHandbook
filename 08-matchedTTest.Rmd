# Matched T Test

## Theory

When both sample means were produced by the same participants, we conduct what is known as a dependent-samplestest. This is a test of the average difference between the scores in one condition and the scores in another condition—thus, the unit of measurement is a difference score.

$\bar{D}=\Sigma D /n$
$D= X_{i1} - X_{i2}$

The mean of this sampling distribution is $\delta$= 0.
The shape of this sampling distribution is approximately normal.
The standard error of the sampling distribution of mean difference scores is

$s_{\bar{D}} = \frac{s_D}{\sqrt{n}}$

$s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(D-\bar{D})^2}}{n-1}}$

The test statistic is 

$t = \frac{\bar{D}-\delta}{s_{\bar{D}}}$
$s_\bar{D} =\frac{s_D}{\sqrt{n}}$

The effect size is calculated 

$d =\frac{\bar{D}}{S_D}$

$S_d = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(D-\bar{D})^2}}{n-1}}$

You are investigating whether the older or younger male in a
pair of brothers tends to be more extroverted. So you test where each one
falls on an introversion-extroversion scale. The results are as follows:

```{r}
# Dep
younger <- c(10,11,18,12, 15)
older <- c(18,17,19,16,15)
dep <- data.frame(younger, older)
```

Step one: State the null and alternative hypotheses

$H_o : \delta = \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$
$H_a : \delta = \mu_1 - \mu_2 != 0$
  

Step two: Set the criterion for rejecting H0. Alpha is usually set to .05, but could be other values depending on the research context. Make sure you’ve considered directionality!

Step three: Select the sample and collect your data.

Step four: Locate the region of rejection and critical values.

$t_{cv,dv=4, \alpha=.05}= +/- 2.77$

Step five: Compute the appropriate statistic. We were never
given $\sigma$or $\sigma^2$, so we use the t test.

$s_D=3.55$
$s_\bar{D} =\frac{s_D}{\sqrt{n}}= \frac{3.35}{\sqrt{5}}$

$t = \frac{\bar{D}-\delta}{s_\bar{D}} = \frac{-3.8-0}{1.50}= -2.53$

Step six: Decide whether to reject H0. Is -2.53 more extreme than the critical value?

$t_{cv,dv=4, \alpha=.05}= +/- 2.77$


“The average extroversion value for the younger male siblings
(M= 13.2) did not differ significantly from the extroversion value
for the older siblings (M= 17.0), t(4) = 2.53, p> .05.”

Effect size computation

$d = \frac{\bar{D}}{s_D}= \frac{-3.8}{3.35} = -1.13$

Small: = 0.25Medium: = 0.50Large: = 1.0

“The average extroversion value for the younger male siblings
(M= 13.2) did not differ significantly from the extroversion value
for the older siblings (M= 17.0), t(4) = 2.53, p> .05, Cohen’s d=
1.13.”

So, why does the effect size calculation disagree with the result
of the hypothesis test?

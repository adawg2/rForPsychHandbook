Learn Stats with R

This is a very early stage repo dedicated to creating a handbook for researchers of any level interested in learning more about statistics and the R language.
Material from the book stems primarily from Jason Hicks' 4111 Intermediate Statistics class at LSU, Jason Harmon's 7111 Multivariate Statistics course, my own material on introducing individual's to R, as well as other sources I've encountered the past few years.

This book is a handbook that will allow anyone wanting to go through the psychologoical statistics rotation at LSU and be able to learn R in the process.

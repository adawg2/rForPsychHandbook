# Data Manipulation in R

This chapter will take you through a brief walk through of cleaning some data in R.
When starting out with R, it's not important that you memorize every command and learn every line, but rather that you start to think about how a computer programmer would solve a question (you!) rather than get an undergrad RA to fix it by hand.

The first thing that you want to do to any script is to put a header on it.
It should cover a few things such as 

* A Title
* Who wrote the script? 
* When did you edit it last?
* What does it do?
* How does it work?
* Does it take anything in specific?

The more information you can provide, the better.
Remember that 6-Month-From-You now is going to be either your best or worst collaborator.

Each script in R out to follow a general pattern.
First list out some information about it, then load in your libraries, and then set your working directory and load your data.

```{r}
 # Import Libraries 
 library(stringr)
 library(data.table)
 library(psych)
```

Next thing you would do is set your working directory and load in your data.
Note here that you need to tell R exactly where to look!

```{r}
# Make sure to load in both datasets as we will want them both in our analysis.
# We also want to make sure to clean both datasets as we are going. 
experiment.data <- read.csv("datasets/Demographic_Data.csv")
item.level.data <- read.csv("datasets/ItemLevelData.csv")
```

You can also import data using RStudio's 'Import Data' function in the top right corner.

![Import Data via RStudio's GUI](img/importdatagui.png)

If you do do that, make sure to add in any of the libraries and code in your script that is printed out below in RStudio's consle!

Next you should familiarize yourself with what your data looks like.
Not only do you have to be cautious of the shape of your data (wide vs. long), but there are a few different types of data that R uses in its functionality.

Looking at the dataset from this experiment, we see lots of different types of data listed.
R did its best to guess what 'kind' of data each one is, but sometimes you have to change data types.

```{r}
str(experiment.data) # Check to see if R guessed correctly on data types
```

Using ```read.csv()``` with its default setting, R had a couple of bad guesses on variables we might need.
We will have to reassign the variable types or else we'll run into trouble later.
In R we use factor for grouping and analysis, best practice is to not set it as that
until you are OK with the format. 
It's easist to manipulate a character or string.
There are much more elegant ways to do this, but just to make a point, I've gone through and fixed each one manually.

Notice how the output of ```str()``` has changed.

```{r}
experiment.data$inst <- as.character(experiment.data$inst)
experiment.data$Gender <- as.character(experiment.data$Gender)
experiment.data$Major <- as.character(experiment.data$Major)
experiment.data$Minor <- as.character(experiment.data$Minor)
experiment.data$BeginTrain <- as.character(experiment.data$BeginTrain)
experiment.data$AbsPitch <- as.character(experiment.data$AbsPitch)
experiment.data$Live12Mo <- as.numeric(experiment.data$Live12Mo)
experiment.data$ActListenMin <- as.character(experiment.data$ActListenMin)

str(experiment.data) # Notice how that our character columns now have " " around them.

```

The next thing we'd want to check in our data cleaning is for any sort of import errors.
We can use combinations of the functions ```names()```,```table()```, ```is.na()```, and ```complete.cases()``` to get a brief summary of what is missing.
You could also use R's plotting funcitonality to see if there are any participants with weird subject numbers or maybe negative values where there should not be. 
If you find any problems, code in the solution in R!
Resist the urge to fix it in the Excel file!

```{r}
# Check for Import Errors 
table(complete.cases(experiment.data)) # Not all observations have everything! 
complete.cases(experiment.data)
table(is.na(experiment.data))
# Gotta decide what to do about it!!
```

Later we'll cover how to change individual cases, but as I will note, you will want to avoid hard coding in any fixes if you can.
Let's first look at how we might fix a messy gender problem.

## Cleaning Response Data

In your data cleaning before you might have noticed that participants were able to freely respond  with whatever gender they wanted. 
Most data look to fall within the normal binary, but the computer needs things to be exactly the same before making an easy split? 
What would be the laziest, most effecient way to fix the gender column? 
What format does the variable have to be in order to make the changes that you need? 
When you have it figured out, make sure to run the code from top to bottom to make sure things go in the right order!!! 
As we are not dealing with huge amounts of data, the table() function will help out.

Let's now take a look at some of these problem ones
Why, for example is Begin Training not working? Print the variable to see.


```{r}
experiment.data$BeginTrain
```

Some people didn't respond, one person decided to tell us what grade they started.
There are 2 ways to go about fixing this. We could "hardcode" the problem if this 
is the only time we will do this analysis on this dataset or we could try to write a
line of code that doesn't care what exact position the error is.
On line 250 in this object is the thing that needs swapping out.
We can access it with R's indexing. Counting from index we see it's in line 250.

```{r}
experiment.data$BeginTrain[250]
```

Quick, ask yourself why we don't use the comma here?! 
If you were set on using the comma, what would you change? 
Ok, now let's swap in the value we want with <-
Remember we are putting a value into a character operator so it has to have "" 

```{r}
experiment.data$BeginTrain[250] <- "12"
experiment.data$BeginTrain 
```
Nice, no more text data, but what if it's not always in 250?
For example, what do we do with all these blank spaces?
Let's use R's inbuilt ifelse() function to go through this vector and swap
out what we want! 

```{r}
ifelse(experiment.data$BeginTrain == "","0",experiment.data$BeginTrain)
```

This works by going through each entry and doing the conditional on the value!
Let's now write over our old column and in the same step make everything a number.
```{r}
experiment.data$BeginTrain <- as.numeric(ifelse(experiment.data$BeginTrain == "","0",experiment.data$BeginTrain))
```

And Alas!

```{r}
experiment.data$BeginTrain
```

Let's now clean up the Gender column, first let's look at it

```{r}
experiment.data$Gender # Are there any common trends?
table(experiment.data$Gender)
```

### Cleaning Up Gender

Pretty much two answers, how do we make them all say one thing?
Let's use the stringr package for this. Import it up top.

```{r}
experiment.data$Gender <- str_to_lower(experiment.data$Gender)
experiment.data$Gender <- str_replace(experiment.data$Gender,"^.*f.*$","Female")
experiment.data$Gender <- str_replace(experiment.data$Gender,"^m.*$","Male")
experiment.data$Gender <- str_replace(experiment.data$Gender,"^country$","No Response")

experiment.data$Gender[30] <- "No Response" #Something Might Be Up w this datapoint?
experiment.data$Gender[63] <- "No Response" #Something Might Be Up w this datapoint?

experiment.data$Gender <- as.factor(experiment.data$Gender)
table(experiment.data$Gender)

#--------------------------------------------------
# Can we do same thing for AP?
experiment.data$AbsPitch
experiment.data$AbsPitch <- str_to_lower(experiment.data$AbsPitch)
experiment.data$AbsPitch <- str_replace(experiment.data$AbsPitch,"^.*n.*$","no")
experiment.data$AbsPitch[30] <- "no"
experiment.data$AbsPitch <- as.factor(experiment.data$AbsPitch)
table(experiment.data$AbsPitch)
```

## Merging Data

Often we will have data from other spreadsheets we want to attach such as demographic data 
to behavioral responses. 
Using the ```data.table``` functionality, let's merge our two csv files together so that we have every variable accessible to us for this analysis. 
Note I like to work with the ```data.table``` package, though there are other ways to do this!

In order to do this, we need 1 shared column between the two datasets.
For most psychology cases, this is probably going to be a participant ID number.
Note that for this to work, you need the columns to have an exact match of name!
First let's check that they are the same!!

```{r}
names(experiment.data)
names(item.level.data)
```

First off our subject ID columns are not the same. Let's swap that.

```{r}
names(item.level.data)
names(experiment.data)
setnames(item.level.data,"tmp.dat.subject.1.","SubjectNo")
setnames(experiment.data,"Sub","SubjectNo") # Make this clearer!!! 
```

If you need to do more than 1, use the c() operator! 
Now if we look at this column, it's all messe up. 
The code below fixes it, if you want to learn more about regex, check it out
if not, just skip below.

```{r}
 
item.level.data$SubjectNo <- str_replace_all(string = item.level.data$SubjectNo, pattern = ".csv", replacement = "")
item.level.data$SubjectNo <- str_replace_all(string = item.level.data$SubjectNo, pattern = "C", replacement = "")
item.level.data$SubjectNo <- str_replace_all(string = item.level.data$SubjectNo, pattern = "M", replacement = "")
item.level.data$SubjectNo <- str_replace_all(string = item.level.data$SubjectNo, pattern = "CM", replacement = "")
item.level.data$SubjectNo <- as.numeric(item.level.data$SubjectNo)

```

Let's just quickly check to see if all the subject numbers make sense

```{r}
hist(experiment.data$SubjectNo) # Cause for alarm! Negative values and placeholders!
```

Notice that the variable of ```SubjectNo``` has negative values and placeholders!
We can use R's indexing function to find these entries.

```{r}
# Drop those 
experiment.data <- experiment.data[experiment.data$SubjectNo > 0 & experiment.data$SubjectNo < 1000,]
```

Note this works because the SubjectNo variable is numeric 

```{r}
hist(experiment.data$SubjectNo)
hist(item.level.data$SubjectNo)
```

Ok, finally we merge our datasets. 
What we are doing here is called an "inner join"
Here we will keep all of the ROWS of the dataset in the middle of the command 
Note we need to swap over our key to be a character value.

```{r}
item.level.data <- data.table(item.level.data)
experiment.data <- data.table(experiment.data)

item.level.data

exp.data <- item.level.data[experiment.data, on="SubjectNo"]

exp.data
```

Let's reorganize our columns so individual stuff is at the back
We could do this with data.table, but it's a different syntax so let's swap back
Normally you try to stick to minimal switching, but we're just taking 
a big tour du R right now and learning to think 


```{r}
exp.data <- data.frame(exp.data)
exp.data <- exp.data[,c(1,40:100,2:39)]
```

## Checking for Univariate Outliers

For this example, let's imagine a univariate outlier is one with a zscore
greater than 3. While we could write a bit of code to look for this, let's use 
the pairs.panels() function in the psych pacakge to just get used to looking at our data
The function is not the biggest fan of huge datasets, so let's index our 
dataset to only grab what we need. Try to change the values and look 
at variables of interest. 

```{r}
pairs.panels(exp.data[,2:7], lm = TRUE)
```

But of course we need to look at numbers in terms of their zscores!
Let's first standardize our entire dataset using the apply function
Note we only can do this on numeric values! 

The apply function takes 3 argument
The first is what you want to manipulate, the second is if it's rows 1 or columns 2
(remeber this because it's always rows then columns!), and the function.
You can even write your own (though we'll get to functions later)

```{r}

gmsi.z.scores <- apply(exp.data[2:7],2,scale)

exp.data.with.z <- cbind(exp.data, gmsi.z.scores)

#Now we can index this to find values above whatever theshold we want!

table(gmsi.z.scores > 2)
gmsi.z.indexer <- gmsi.z.scores > 2
gmsi.z.scores[gmsi.z.indexer] # See what they are, find them , decide to get rid of
```

### Checking for Multivariate Outliers

A bit tricker, I leanred how to do this off a blog post.

```{r}
gmsi.responses <- exp.data[,c(63:100)]

mahal <- mahalanobis(gmsi.responses,
                     colMeans(gmsi.responses, na.rm = TRUE), 
                     cov(gmsi.responses, 
                         use = "pairwise.complete.obs"))                    ## Create Distance Measures

cutoff <- qchisq(.999, ncol(gmsi.responses))                                ## Create cutoff object .001 signifiance and DF = obs
summary(mahal < cutoff)                                                     ## 11 Subjects greater than 70 cutoff 

# Add On Variables 
exp.data$mahal <- mahal
exp.data <- data.table(exp.data) # To use easier indexer, needs data.table 
exp.data[exp.data$mahal < cutoff]
```

### Checking for Skew and Kurtosis 

```{r}
apply(gmsi.responses, 2, skew)
apply(gmsi.responses, 2 , kurtosi)

```


### Exporting Data

It's best practice to separate your cleaning and your analysis into separate scripts.
Export the dataset you have into a new csv file into a directory that would make sense to 
someone who has never seen your project before. 
```{r}
write.csv(exp.data,"datasets/My_Experiment_Data.csv")
```

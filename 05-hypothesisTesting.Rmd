# Hypothesis Testing

The sampling distribution of the mean helps us to make hypotheses about the likelihood that a given sample mean comes from a sampling distribution with a given mean.

Stated differently, a hypothesis test helps us determine whether the observed difference between a sample mean and a hypothetical population mean is either negligible or meaningful.

The Null Hypothesis $H_o : \mu = some value$ 
The alternative Hypothesis $H_o : != \mu = some value$

The Alternative Hypothesis

A sample mean of a given sample size is produced and compared to the hypothetical sampling distribution’s mean to test the null hypothesis

Imagine we know the population (for some reason) and the True value is 455.

The hypothesis test is based on inference (i.e., inductive reasoning), and therefore there is a chance that mistaken inferences will be made.

A Type I erroris produced when we mistakenly reject the null. It is associated with probability alpha ($\alpha$), or the level of significance.

We conventionally set this level to be .05in psychology, but there are considerations to be made for increasing or decreasing this value (e.g., .01 or .10).

A Type II erroris produced when we mistakenly fail to reject the null. It is associated with probability beta ($\beta$), which is related to, but not the same as, alpha.

The level of significance creates the bounds for the rejection region—the extreme region(s) under the sampling distribution equal to αif the null hypothesis is true.

The directionality of the test should also be considered.

Hypothesis tests differ slightly when population parameters, such as $\sigma^2$, are known versus unknown.

The general formula for a test statistic $Statistic - parameter /SE$

When $\sigma^2$is known, we use the standard error of the normal distribution as the denominator. The result is the ztest.

When $\sigma^2$ is unknown, we use the t distributionas our sampling distribution, with a standard error that must be estimated from $s^2$ or $s$. The result is the ttest.

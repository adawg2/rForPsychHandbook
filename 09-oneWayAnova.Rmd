# One Way ANOVA

In cases where the number of groups in a study (K) is more than two, we cannot use the ttest for the hypothesis test because there is an associated cost.
2.
The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), or Ftest, controls the experimentwiseType I error rate while simultaneously allowing a test of the equality of multiple population means.
3.
Every given score in a data set differs somewhat from the overall, or grand, mean of the data set. But this distance from the grand mean can be partitioned into the distance from the score to its group mean and the distance from that group mean to the grand mean.
4.
There are several assumptions that should be met when using ANOVA.

Effect size and power for the ANOVA

Performing multiple ttests across multiple groups in a single study increases the likelihood of at least one Type I error occurring across the “family” of comparisons
b. Experimentwise(familywise) Type I errorrate = 1 –(1 –α)c, where
c= number of independent ttests to be conducted
For example, if I wanted to conduct a test for eachpairwise
comparison in a 3-group study, my experimentwiseerror rate would
be 1 –(1 -.05)3= .142
For 4 conditions, it would be 6 tests and 1 –(1 -.05)6= .265

The one-way ANOVAis used to analyze data generated by the manipulation of one independent variable with at least 2 levels. Each group, or condition, created by the manipulation is called a level.
b. The null hypothesis—H0:
c.The alternative hypothesis—Ha: , for some pair of groups iand k

The concept behind the ANOVA is that we use two estimates of the population variance associated with the null hypothesis
i. One estimate is the within-groups variation ( ): the influence on variance due to error (chance factors like individual differences), which is presumed to be the same within each group ( )
ii. The other estimate is the between-groupsvariation ( ): the influence on variance due to the independent variable or treatment
( ), plus error due to the random process of group assignment ( )

iii. The test statistic involves created a ratio of the between-groups to the within-group variation:

Every given score in a data set differs somewhat from the overall, or grand, mean of the data set. But this distance from the grand mean can be partitioned into the distance from the score to its group mean and the distance from that group mean to the grand mean.

Obtaining estimates of variance in our data is the trick in the ANOVA.
a.
An individual score in an ANOVA model is comprised of 3 components. The linear model is , where μis the grand mean, αkis the effect of belonging to group k, and eikis random error.
b.
The distance from a score to its group mean essentially reflects error only, whereas the distance from a group mean to the grand mean reflects the effect of the treatment + error


Obtaining estimates of variance in our data is the trick in the ANOVA.
c.
The total variation in a data set, then, can be split into that due to within-group variation + between-group variation. In terms of sums of squares:
d.
These SS estimates must be divided by their respective dfto obtain the estimates of the average variability within-groups and the average variability between-groups.

F STATISTIC FROMULA

If there is no treatment effect due to the independent variable (i.e., the null
hypothesis is true), then we expect this ratio to be roughly equal to 1.

However, if there is a treatment effect due to the independent variable (i.e.,
the null hypothesis is false), then we expect this ratio to be > 1.

### Assumptions of ANOVA

a. To be representative of the populations from which they were drawn, the observations in our samples must be random and independent.
b. The population distributions from which our samples were drawn are normal, which implies that our dependent variable is normally distributed.
c.The variances of our population distributions are equal (homogeneity of variance).
d.Generally speaking, the ANOVA is robust to minor violations of the normality and variance assumptions, except for cases in which heterogeneity is coupled with unequal sample sizes

### Practice

Scenario: Does the ethnicity of a defendant affect the likelihood that he is judged guilty? People were given transcripts of a trial and asked to judge the likelihood that a defendant was guilty, on a 0 –10 scale. The transcript was identical, but across 3 conditions, the reported ethnicity of the defendant varied. The results were as follows (study based on Stephen, 1975):

```{r}
white <- c(6,7,3,2,3,5,0)
black <- c(10,9,4,10,10,3)
hispanic <- c(6,10,5,5,10,2) 
```

Step six: Interpret (was null rejected?).
We do NOT reject the null, because the Fvalue did not exceed the Fcv
“The ethnicity of the defendant did not significantly affect the
average guilt rating given by mock jurors, F(2, 15) = 2.34, p> .05.”

## Effect Size Measures

An effect size measure, f, is used to represent the population SD between
groups from the grand mean, versus population SD within a group

We can then use the noncentrality parameter for the Fdistribution,
related highly to phi, to estimate power

$\phi = f * \sqrt{n}$
$n = \frac\{\phi}{f}^2$

Consult Table A.10 for values of phi, based on number of
groups (K) and the likely dfw(although this has a modest influence)

$n = \frac\{\phi}{f}^2$

What if we desired .80 power? How many subjects?

In Table A.10, with k= 3 and dfw= 16, phi = 2.0

This type of measure is comparable to R2in regression
Interpretation: roughly 28% of the variance in the DV (i.e., guilt
ratings) can be attributed to the IV (i.e., the race of the defendant).
But it is upwardly biased—it overpredictsthe population eta-squared

![anova](img/hicksanova15.png)

Interpretation: roughly 13% of the variance in the DV (i.e., guilt
ratings) can be attributed to the IV (i.e., the race of the defendant).

Cohen (1977) recommends the following convention:
≈ .01 is “small”
≈ .06 is “medium”
≥.15 is “large”

Look for “adjusted R squared” notation in the SPSS ANOVA output
from the Univariatemethod of performing the ANOVA
